# Group Ten: Pet Adoption Platform - We Do Care

## Five Major Functions

1. **Login System**: Includes both login and registration functionalities. During registration, users need to fill in basic information before entering their username and password. Users who have already registered only need to input their username and password again.

2. **Post Adoption Information**: Compiles information and uploads data of pets available for adoption to the database. Information includes pet name, breed, gender, health condition, and sterilization status.

3. **Display Adoption Information**: Displays the compiled data, categorizing pets by breed. Users can select a category they are interested in and further view detailed information by clicking on the photos of the pets.

4. **Chatroom**: Provides a communication channel for users interested in the posted adoption information. By selecting the chatroom option below the adoption post, users can directly communicate with the pet owner.

5. **Pet Hospitals**: Allows users to locate nearby pet hospitals from their current location, facilitating prompt medical treatment for pets.

## Additional Features

- **Notification System**: Implement a notification system to alert users about new adoption posts, messages in the chatroom, or important updates related to the platform.

- **User Profile Management**: Develop functionality for users to manage their profiles, including updating personal information, viewing adoption history, and tracking ongoing conversations in the chatroom.
